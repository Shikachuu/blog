# How-to create a declarative MacOS setup the simple wayâ„¢ nr.1

As you read more and more about dotfiles, dotfile managers or you are comming from some sort of linux community like me
you probably got overwhelmed and bored by some nerds over explaining and analyzing dotfile management.

Every time you try to find some solution you will most definetly find at least one post that will try to convince you that
you must use a tool like [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) or you have to use [the Nix package mansger](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin)
or use someone else's dotfile template on your mac to properly cofigure it.

While it's good for some people and I respect that mentality I've always find these kind of solutions too "scary" and overly complex.
I mean I only need to change a few defaults (pun intended), install a bunch of packages and copy a few config files, I don't want to learn
a whole new language, organize the stuff into N different folders and trust a tool that will make the right calls for me.

## Setting the correct requirements

Since my use case here (and I think most people's case) are easy to solve and doesn't required such complex abstractions
that the before mentioned tools offer, we can strip down the requirement to the bare minimum and explore what the already existing tools on our machine can do!

As I've already mentioned this a few times, I lowkey have 3 really simple requirements:

- install all the required packages
- have some config files on the correct place
- override a few defaults

There are some really obvious simple solutions to these problems that we already know: shell scripts and symlinks, sounds easy enough right?
While these solutions are mostly fine at the end of the day declarative configurations are way easier to read and write, let's figure out the solution 1-by-1.

## Brewfile and `brew bundle`

You probably already have brew installed on your machine, if you go on an adventure in brew's documentation you can quickly find yourself
discovering [`brew bundle`](https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile) a command.
Essentially you can create a file that's using a Ruby based DSL, to specify the packages you want to install.
The good news that it already supports multiple package types and other package managers besides brew,
so we can essentially use this to declare all the packages we need to install in a simple file like this:

```ruby
brew "fzf"
brew "gh"
brew "go"

# or you can use full pacakge names
brew "jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit"

# use cask and fronts
cask "font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font"
cask "ghostty"

# even apps from the store
mas "Refined GitHub", id: 1519867270

# or just straight up write ruby style conditions
if File.exist?(File.expand_path("~/.work"))
    mas "Slack", id: 803453959
end
```

**However like with every tool there are some catches:**

- `mas` only works if it's installed
- `mas` based dependencies will not install automatically (the CLI will fail) if you haven't manually "purchased" an app and it's not already in your library
- conditions can be tricky
- the documentation is straight up dogwater, nobody will tell you that u can use loops, conditions and variable substitution
- since it has been moved to the main repo even the existing really good README.md went away

**There are some upsides too:**

- it's in the main `Homebrew/brew` repo and is a part of brew so you don't need a separate tool for it
- the CLI commands are super useful running `brew bundle check || brew bundle install` or simply `brew bundle` is awesome
- it will take care of updates for you
- you can easily remove packages with `brew bundle cleanup`
- you can even easily migrate to this thanks to `brew bundle dump` which will create a Brewfile from your current packages

## Closure

This is a perfect solution for us we can still "play around" and avoid "state drifting" by periodically running `brew bundle dump`.

For live example check out my [Brewfile](https://github.com/Shikachuu/dotfiles/blob/main/macos/Brewfile) in my dotfiles repo!

In the next iteration we will focus on the configuration handling part!
